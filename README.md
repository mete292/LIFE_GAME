# LIFE_GAME
 The "LIFE GAME," also known simply as "LIFE," is a cellular automaton (Cellular Automata, Cellular Spaces) designed by the English mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970 for cellular simulation purposes. The "Game" is a game without players, meaning that it starts from an initial state, and its evolution continues iteratively over time. It is essentially a simulation tool designed according to the rules of "life" and "death" for cells.  In this simulation, cells have two possible states: "ALIVE" or "DEAD."   The purpose of the game is to test the life and death states of cells in a given region during each life cycle (iteration) and observe the results based on a defined initial state.  The universe of the LIFE GAME consists of a 2D grid of squares, where each square represents a cell that can only have one of two possible states: "ALIVE" or "DEAD." Each cell interacts with 8 adjacent neighboring cells (horizontally, vertically, and diagonally), as shown in Figure 2 (red cell and its neighbors). During each iteration, the next state of each cell is determined based on the following rules:
